# What is the difference between `let`, `var` and `const` in JavaScript?
`var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned within its scope. `let` and `const` are block-scoped and have block-level scope. `let` allows reassignment but not redeclaration within the same scope, while `const` does not allow reassignment or redeclaration.

# Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that you can access variables and functions before they are declared in your code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

# What are the different ways to loop through an array in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, you can loop through an array using `for` loops, `forEach()` method, `for..of` loop, or `map()` method. Each method has its own advantages and use cases depending on the scenario.


# What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?
`null` represents the intentional absence of any value and is typically assigned to a variable explicitly by the programmer. `undefined` indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value yet, or a property does not exist in an object.


# Explain the concept of the event loop in JavaScript.
The event loop is a crucial component of JavaScript's concurrency model. It continuously checks the call stack for tasks to execute and the task queue for events to process. When the call stack is empty, the event loop moves tasks from the queue to the stack for execution, ensuring that asynchronous operations are handled in a non-blocking manner while maintaining the single-threaded nature of JavaScript.


# What is event delegation in JavaScript?
Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element that will fire for all descendants matching a selector, including dynamically added elements. This approach is often used to improve performance and manage event handling for large sets of elements efficiently.


# How do you handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript?
Asynchronous operations in JavaScript are commonly handled using callbacks, Promises. These mechanisms allow developers to write non-blocking code and handle asynchronous tasks such as fetching data from servers, reading files, or executing time-consuming operations without blocking the main execution thread.


# What are the different ways to define functions in JavaScript?
Functions in JavaScript can be defined using function declarations, function expressions, arrow functions, and method definitions within object literals or classes.


# How does prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects through a mechanism called prototypal inheritance. Each object has a prototype object, and if a property or method is not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks for it in the prototype chain until it reaches the top-level object prototype.


# Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript.
Closures refers to the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state. They allow JavaScript functions to retain access to variables from their containing scope even after the parent function has finished executing.


# What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for making dynamic and interactive web pages. It is commonly used for client-side web development but can also be utilized for server-side development.
